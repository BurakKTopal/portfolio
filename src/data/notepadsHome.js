            Hello there &#x1F604;
            <p>
                I'm Burak Kucuktopal and I'm 20 years old. Since I was young, I always wanted to reveal my thoughts to the broader public,
                and have some website to gather all my experiences, projects and also important dates. Something that resembles a biography. Due to the lack
                of knowledge and the limited programming skills, it quite took some time to realize this. But here it is!
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            I have introduced the concept of 'notepads' in this blog. This means that every story is written on a single notepad, and you can look at the backside
            of it by clicking on the arrow indicated at the bottom. You will notice that these notepads have more than two sides &#x1F609;
        </p>
        <p>
            There are currently 3 different pads, and thus stories:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The first will talk some about my educational carreer. I have finished Mathematics and Physics for my Bachelor's. Since
                these are two different fields, I will talk about my feeling for each of these fields. Additionally, I have
                added my results in a plot for each semester, or a year in total. I felt these three years as a really special track, which
                motivates why I would not only give my grades, but the thoughts and expectations I got for each of these subjects. The description
                can be found by clicking on the points of the plot that is presented for either Mathematics of Physics.
            </li>
            <li>
                The second one talks about my work experience and what my tasks were at these places.
            </li>
            <li>
                the third part will be about the programming projects I've realized. This can go from the highlights of my study, to the programming portfolios I've
                made. I personally think that this will be the most interesting, as it is the most concrete one.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The following are yet to be written, so keep tight!
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                At last, I've added the extra-curricular activities, and some special events that stands out. This will go more about my short 'professional' carreer
                as chess player, all the way to how I got the chance to present my bachelor Thesis in front of more than 100 persons.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            If you are curious about any point in my story, you can contact me by the form at the end of this story, euhm page. Btw, if you would suffer to
            depression due to the dark color of this page, you can always switch to light mode by using the button at the upper left corner. I've set it default on dark to spare
            my eyes when I work on this project in the late nights &#x1F601;

        At UHasselt, to adapt to college, we started with a half-semester. This half-semester counted three introductory, but also fundamental courses:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Calculus 1</li>
        <li>Basic Concepts in Mathematics</li>
        <li>Mechanics</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        It was after this half-semester, that I started with the TWIN track. For the first semester, I only had the following courses for Mathematics, which
        started to deviate a lot from what I already knew. From this point on, attention was needed!
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Basic Concepts in the Algebra and Analysis</li>
        <li>Calculus 2</li>

    </ul>
    <p>
        In my second semester, it was Mathematics that got the overhand in number of courses:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data analysis and statistical models 1</li>
        <li>Analysis 1</li>
        <li>Linear Algebra</li>

        <li>Differential Geometry 1: Curves and Surfaces</li>

    {/* <p>
    The first semester of my second year was personally the most difficult one! After we had had Analysis 1, we continued to delve further into the abstractness of Analysis 2.
    This subject was unanimously agreed as the hardest course of the bachelor by the students. It counted over 100 pages, to which there was a proof for nearly every page! Nonetheless,
    with keeping track of what's happening throughout the year, it is certainly possible to perform well.  
</p>
<p>
    Additionlly, there was algebra 1, which talks more about abstract structures should as groups, p-sylow subgroups and many more.

        In my first and second year, there was almost no room to take additional courses because this was already fully scheduled by the TWIN-track. Starting from the third year, there
        was some more room for this. Actually, this little bit of breathing room is not made to take some extra courses and increase the workload, but to actually work hard and good on your
        bachelor thesis, which I discuss in my portfolios section, as it is expected to be satisfying (high expectations I suppose).
    </p>
    <p>
        Although the warning, I did take some non-mandatory courses for TWIN at Mathematics, but this was only at the second semester. In my first semester, I had the two courses:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Complex Analysis</li>
        <li>Fundamentals in probability Theory and Statistics (Statistics 3)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In my second semester, I had far more subjects, counting up to 6 courses for Mathematics. Three compulsory, three optional
    </p>
    <p>compulsory:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Dynamical Systems</li>
        <li>Partial Differential Equations</li>

            To be honest, I would have never thought that I would be studying pure Physics. I understood the concepts and my understanding represented this well, but
            doing a bachelor in Physics never came to mind. But as I want to seize every opportunity, I'd taken the TWIN track as a challenge and picked up Physics along the way, and
            did not have any regret.
        </p>
    </div>
    <p>
        The courses that I've had during my bachelor's degree were characterized by more theoretical fields (Quantum mechanics) to the more practical ones (fluid dynamics). Even
        some computer science could be found.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quantum & Classical Mechanics</li>

    <p>
        Due to my high interest in Computer science, I’ve also taken the extra course:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Computer Networks (Full discussion on the TCP/IP protocol stack
            together with Python implementations)</li>

    <p>
        This year, and certainly this semester I experienced as the hardest one, but also the most successful one! This was due to the fact that I had many courses from
        Physics, but also one of the hardest courses in Mathematics, one being Analysis 2. Additionally, the schema for my exams
        were very tough. More specifically, the first week I had 2 exams on Tuesday, and two exams in that same week on Thursday! Yet, with some
        stress and dedication, I managed.
    </p>
    <p>
        This semester, we also started to get more into the experimental side of Physics:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hydrodynamics</li>
        <li>Quantum Mechanics 2</li>
        <li>Thermodynamics</li>

        <li>Mathematical methods of physics</li>
        <li>Advanced Measurement Methods</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The second semester was mainly governed by an experimental project to prepare us for the bachelor thesis in the third year.
    </p>
    <ul>

        In the past two years, we mainly focussed on getting our basics right. In the final year of our study, we started to delve into
        the more serious subjects.

        The first semester the subsequent courses were:

        During my internship at Mobile Vikings, I covered a broad spectrum of programming. I developed a complete frontend for their mock server using React and Next.js, along with Radix-UI. My implementation provided our frontend team with a tool to facilitate user testing and created a project that will be used for many years across different teams due to its UI/UX friendliness and flexibility in making adjustments, thanks to its clean code.
    </p>
    <p>
        Additionally, I improved the Node.js mock server for which I developed the frontend. At the beginning of my internship, this primarily involved adapting several endpoints to make the appropriate calls. As the project progressed, our team realized that the architecture of the mock server could be enhanced. After completing the frontend, I rolled up my sleeves and restructured the entire system into an ORM-based Node.js server using Prisma.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my previous role at iinno-benelux, the technical team was very small. At Mobile Vikings, I further developed my teamwork and presentation skills while also gaining a strong grasp of advanced Git operations.

    </p>
    <p>
        This smart algorithm is what I've implemented and optimized. As it doesn't stop with merely an algorithm, I've made a CRUD API in Flask-RestX, and a complete frontend. Hence this could be seen is an automation software,
        making it easier to apply the smart algorithm, while being able to easily change the necessary parameters.

                I've always had a passion for creating and observing how things work. Initially, pursuing an engineering degree seemed like the perfect fit, and everyone around me agreed. However, everything changed during my last year of high school.
            </p>
        </div>
        <p>
            Since Languages aren't my strongest part, Mathematics and Physics became my beloved subjects. During summer breaks, I eagerly awaited the delivery of my books to dive deeper into Mathematical concepts. However, I never considered pursuing these subjects further in college, as I associated Mathematics solely with teaching high school—a path that didn't appeal to me. Engineering had been my childhood dream, and I intended to pursue it.
        </p>
        <p>
            That all changed during the 'thematic days' in my final year of high school. Despite already dedicating eight hours a week to Mathematics by my studies, I chose to delve deeper into 'logic'. Those three days became the highlight of my year. While it wasn't the complex proofs I'd encounter later, the abstract nature and rigorous approach sparked something within me. It was then that I realized pursuing engineering might not fulfill my desire for theoretical rigor and abstract problem-solving. As for future career prospects, I was uncertain, but following my passion and dreams seemed like the right path forward.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2021, I enrolled in Mathematics. By the end of my first semester, I qualified for the 'TWIN-track', allowing me to study additional Physics subjects alongside Mathematics. This dual-degree track, however, didn't require me to complete 360 credits in three years due to overlapping coursework. I eventually completed 245 credits, thanks to exemptions granted based on my performance in related subjects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below, I'll share my experiences in this academic journey, including insights into challenging topics, intriguing discoveries, and areas of particular interest.

    <p>
        Programming has had many ups and downs for me. I started with C++ in 2019. Naively, I chose this difficult language as my introduction to programming, which led to only a basic understanding of its syntax. I used this knowledge for a small numerical analysis assignment, but C++'s complexity demotivated me, and I stopped coding for a long time after that project.
    </p>
    <p>
        Three years later, I gave programming another try, this time with Python. I followed courses on Codecademy, which steadily solidified my knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2023, perhaps influenced by COVID, I experienced a programming boom. I created my first chess engine with a GUI using Pygame and an alpha-beta pruning algorithm. That summer, I focused more on Python, designing a neural network from scratch and testing it on the MNIST dataset, achieving over 95% accuracy.
    </p>
    <p>
        In my third year of my Bachelor's, I took an elective course in Computer Science: Computer Networks. I learned about the IP/TCP ISO model, and set up HTTP servers and proxies in Python. I concluded the course by developing an efficient synchronized gaming protocol on TCP, complete with RFC-like documentation.
    </p>
    <p>
        After this project, I shifted my focus back to C++ and Qt, designing a banking app with a localhost implementation and transaction capabilities.
    </p>
    <p>
        And this is just the beginning, there are many more to come &#x1F60A;

const bankingAppContent = <>
    <p>
        All projects I had worked on were written in Python, it was time to diversify. One way I did this is by creating a C++ banking app using
        Qt. You can create an account, and deposit as well as withdrawal money from it.
    </p>
    <p>
        The architecture that I've implemented is the client-server architecture. Suppose you do a withdrawal, in that case by using Byte streams, the information
        is being sent to the remote server. By the usage of identifiers in your message, the server knows which action to perform. The action is being performed on the
        local SQLite file, to which the server queries to read and update information.
    </p>
    <img src={BankingAppActions} className="invert-for-gray" />

    <p>
        By the use of C++/Qt threading, multiple clients are supported and can by using eachothers bank details deposit money to eachoter. Clients can by refreshing there transfers,
        look at the recent one that has come in.

const sgpdescription = <>
    <p>
        The motivation to create this so-called SGP protocol was by the course Computer Networks that I've taken in my third year. We had learned a lot about
        how internet protocols (TCP, IP, HTTP, FTP and many, many more) thrive to optimize. I was really fascinated by how such a thought process is initiated and with the structure in the
        documentation that is written alongside. </p>
    <p>
        As a result, in early november I started on an application protocol working on TCP and within a server-client architectural setup, which quickly became very interesting. The ground base I had was an offline
        2D game that I've found, and my mission was to make it online by the use of a (application-layer) protocol.
    </p>
    <p>
        My first attempt in making this online game, was by using designing protocol
        in which each client plays a move on his own device, immediately changing their own game state. Only after the client himself
        has played the move, would it be sent to the server. This is all well and good, if the ping time is low. But
        in scenarios where one player has a very low ping time, while the other has a very high ping time, the (supposedly) same
        game would look totally different on their screens. One way to resolve high latency is by saving a buffer
        at the server and if he sees a big mismatch he 'corrects' the game states of the players.
    </p>
    <p>
        One can code this 'buffering/interpolating' system in a very sophisticated manner so that the other clients
        wouldn't notice anything for decent pings. But I wanted to have a robust, and very low (application-layer) data transfer
        working protocol which works decent, and does not buffer the game state of the
        clients.
    </p>
    <p>
        To do this, I have made use of two, rather 'weird', concepts; the <span style={{ fontSize: 'italic' }}>fake moves</span> which plays a move locally to check for
        validity before it attempts to sends to the server, and
        the concept of <span style={{ fontSize: 'italic' }}>echoing your own move</span> to be able to synchronize the screens of all players over different locations.
        All these things only work together with the introduction of myself created algorithm: <span style={{ fontSize: 'italic' }}>the synchronization algorithm</span>.
        This algorithm is visually represented as follows.
    </p>
    <img src={synchronizationProtocol} className="invert-for-white" />
    <figcaption>Synchronization algorithm applied on two clients on two different devices</figcaption>
    <h3>Super-efficient algorithm</h3>
    <p>
        Not only did this protocol work, within the game that I've made online it is super efficient. In the description of the Github repository, I've made some
        data analysis. This analysis showed that for a game of 40 seconds, the average byte transfer between the server and the client and vice versa is only 1.36 bytes!
        This is also nicely shown by the plot of the byte transfer of each client within the span of the game, that I've displayed here.

    <p>
        AI was in the past always a mistery box due to my lack of Mathematical knowledge. Starting with my study in Mathematics in college, this was no problem anymore.
        Hence, I came to the idea to create my very own number recognition AI, and not using any library at all, but by writing is from scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
        Besides the design and the creation of the AI, I wanted some extra. This extra's embodies the implementation of a little own library to create
        custom neural network designs. This means that you can choose the number of layers, and coupled to this layer you can also choose:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>The number of nodes per layer</li>
        <li>The activation function used for the layer</li>
        <li>If there is a bias neuron or not in that layer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Not only can you choose the architectural design, it is also made possible to choose the weights adaptation, which encapsulates adapting each weight matrices':
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Batch size: the number of training iterations before the weight matrices are updated</li>
        <li>The learning rate of that specific weight matrix</li>
    </ul>
    Finally, I've also implemented a save and load feature. This way, after each training session, the model is saved in a *.pkl file, and read out in the following sessions.

    <h3>Testing on the MNIST data set</h3>
    <p>
        I also have included a test of my AI on the MNIST data set. The architecture I'd chosen was a 3-layered 784x522x10 model, together with two bias neurons. The loss function
        was MSE and the activation function for the hidden and the output layer where the typical sigmoid.

const ChessDescription = <>
    <p>
        I got interested in playing chess at the age of 13 and really started playing when I was 14. At 16, I became the regional champion of my age category, and at 17, I became the regional champion of all age categories.
        However, my eagerness to play chess took a slight dive after that. To revive this interest and improve my Python skills, I started making a chess program in March 2023 within the OOP paradigm.
        After two hard weeks, I developed a program where moves could be played by entering them in the console using general chess notation. It didn't have an engine, wasn't optimized, and wasn't user-friendly,
        as not everyone knows proper chess notation. The code was a complex cluster of if and for loops and wasn't even commented. Despite its flaws, it worked, and was happy with it. I knew that one day I'd need to clean it up to present it properly.
    </p>
    <p>
        On August 15 2023, I started looking back into my program. At first glance, it was really chaotic; it took me, the very own maker of the program, two full days to go through it and clean it up.
        I've added an UI using Pygame, and made chess engines which can play on different search depths using alpha-beta pruning. I've also incorporated Zobrist hashing to encode every position to detect transpositions
        to reduce the calculation time.
    </p>
    <p>
        It may not be that fast, but as a first decent, programming project I was and still satisfied with what I've built.

        The first real project we worked on, was during in my second to last year of high school about the Mathematical applications in the medical
        world. This was in 2020. After this big project, there were many assignments and little tasks that were given by college, but I these are not
        tasks that take hours and hours of work, but more side quests.
    </p>
    <p>
        Actually, programming had a lot of ups and downs. It was in 2019 that I started with programming in C++, obviously underestimating how hard
        this language is. Hence, I only got the understanding of the basic syntax. I did use this basic knowledge for some little assignment about
        numerical analysis, which wasn't spectacular at all. After this, coding kind of cooled down for me.
    </p>
    <p>
        It took 2 more years to get back to it. This time with the more logical approach by starting with Python. I followed some courses on
        Codecademy and solidified my knowledge in this programming language. Slowly, yet surely.
    </p>
    <p>
        In 2022, I experienced a programming boom and ever since intensively worked on improving my coding skills.
